        <h1>Lauren Chapman</h1>
        <h2>From Lima, Peru</h2>
        
         <p>I grew up in Lima, Peru, and am now studying at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
         <p>
            I work at the BJA Child Development Center and enjoy working with babies and little children. I am a member of Hampton Park Baptist Church.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy playing the piano and violin, baking, knitting, spending time with friends and family, and sometimes reading. My favorite book is the Lord of the Rings.
         </p>
         <p> 
            Some things that make me happy are dogs, little children, homemade food, and the sky right after a rain.
