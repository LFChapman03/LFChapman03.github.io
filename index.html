        <h2>From Lima, Peru</h2>
        
         <p>I grew up in Lima, Peru, and am now at Bob Jones University in Greenville, SC.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Southside Baptist Church of Gaffney, SC.  I teach Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group and I run the Sound / Video Projection System during services.  I also drive the church bus for weekend activities.

         <p>
            I also enjoy running / hiking as well as a good book
